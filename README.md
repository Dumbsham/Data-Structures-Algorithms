# 🚀 Data Structures & Algorithms Practice Repository  

This repository contains my solutions and practice code for **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)**. It is a collection of problems solved from various platforms and topics, organized for easy reference and revision.  

## 📂 Structure  
```
The repository is organized by topics and subfolders: 
DSA/
│
├── Arrays/
├── Strings/
├── Recursion/
├── LinkedList/
├── Trees/
├── Graphs/
└── Miscellaneous/ 
```
Each folder contains problem statements and solutions (mostly in **C++**, but may include other languages as I progress).  

## ✨ Goals  

- Strengthen problem-solving skills  
- Build a strong foundation for **competitive programming** and **technical interviews**  
- Maintain a consistent practice schedule 

## 🛠️ Tech Stack  

- **Language:** C++ (Primary)  
- **Tools:** VS Code, GCC Compiler  
- **Platforms:** LeetCode, GFG, CodeStudio, Codeforces, etc.  

## 🔖 Progress  

I will be continuously updating this repository as I solve more problems.  

- ✅ Arrays & Strings Basics  
- 🔄 Recursion (In Progress)  
- ⏳ Advanced topics coming soon...  

## 🤝 Contributions  

This is primarily for my personal learning. However, suggestions and improvements are always welcome!
